for growth model, looking to pull through:
 - site productivity class (SITECLCD)
 - stand age (STDAGE and maybe the other age thing?)
 - another volume variable
 - maybe MEASYEAR?
 - maybe carbon?

first four are sorted, carbon is not.

note that time-varying variables (MEASYEAR, STDAGE, FLDAGE) are dropped at end of processing

what's the right thing to do for conditions with time-varying site productivity class?

keeping just the first site productivity class for now

pick a naming style and stick to it
