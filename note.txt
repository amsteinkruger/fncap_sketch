working on:

accomodating different counts of period for different condition-years
incorporating B1
switching to functional programming to estimate many models over site class codes, etc.

notes from scratch work in R/Julia:

disturbances in only 187 of 2880 conditions (not counting by year, so fewer w/in interval of interest)
of those 187, year of disturbance is recorded for only 85
disturbances are distributed somewhat uniformly over codes, 
with disease damage, wind, and grazing (top three) accounting for a little over a third of obs

treatment is more common (488 obs), with removals accounting for 420 of those obs.
replanting and other commercial treatment account for almost all remaining 68 obs.

problems:

worth bothering about DSTRBCD > 1, TRTCD > 1?
