NB: .ipynb is not updated, only _process.jl, _visualize.R are updated and running

immediate goal is for _explore.jl to replicate and extend _visualize.R

then follow-in is to bring _model_scratch up to snuff with changes listed below

then finally the .ipynb will be due for an update with fresh data glimpses, intermediate exploration, and model fits

also

pick a naming style and stick to it (for modeling, where some names inherit from MATLAB and others don't)

doing:

(*) pull all variables of interest (except carbon) through with summarize
(~) describe changes in time-varying variables, especially SITECLCD, in quick plots
break out disturbances and responses in more quick plots
change model to accomodate different counts of period for different condition-years
change model to use B1 per Matt's comment
extend model to estimate many models
demo over site class and species

notes to pass on:

disturbances in only 187 of 2880 conditions (not counting by year, so fewer w/in interval of interest)
of those 187, year of disturbance is recorded for only 85
disturbances are distributed somewhat uniformly over codes, 
with disease damage, wind, and grazing (top three) accounting for a little over a third of obs

treatment is more common (488 obs), with removals accounting for 420 of those obs.
replanting and other commercial treatment account for almost all remaining 68 obs.

problems:

handle missing for VOLBFNET, DRYBIO, CARBON?

worth bothering about DSTRBCD > 1, TRTCD > 1?




is thinning removal (as treatment)?
DK: check rough plot for subset of cond/plot/year w/o treatment or disturbance
MS: line up disturbances w/ changes in site class
DK: maybe set up conversion function for VOLB, VOLC
