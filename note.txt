problem: coarseness around ignition dates and years in MTBS
 - i.e. we might care a lot about ignition dates close to and during notification periods

- break /data/ into buckets (e.g. Notifications, TreeMap*, TCC)
- * and get other TreeMap years for reference

- expanding data joins to complete set of 2014-2025 notifications
