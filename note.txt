q: are we selecting and parameterizing "new" growth functions where Wang and Lewis pulled from Hashida and Lewis?
q: is the subjective burn probability just Wang and Lewis's radius thing?

working on:

- checking harvest notifications w/ alternative order of filters to get a better flat/spatial join
- setting up notification-MTBS intersect(s) following Wang and Lewis

- doing something with harvest notifications
- iterating over several models for combinations of categorical variables in the data, e.g. site class and pyrome
- adding stand destruction probabilities to the growth model
- adding other disturbances and treatments
- adding error quantification/visualization for the growth model
- parsing out post-SD initial conditions
- handling CA/WA data

notes from scratch work in R/Julia:

disturbances in only 187 of 2880 conditions (not counting by year, so fewer w/in interval of interest)
of those 187, year of disturbance is recorded for only 85
disturbances are distributed somewhat uniformly over codes, 
with disease damage, wind, and grazing (top three) accounting for a little over a third of obs

treatment is more common (488 obs), with removals accounting for 420 of those obs.
replanting and other commercial treatment account for almost all remaining 68 obs.
