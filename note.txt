Notification Problems:
 - Handling names of landowners, companies (, operations?).
 - Handling flat observations without (?) corresponding spatial observations (check whether they'd get past filters).
 - Checking whether multiple/many-many results of flat-spatial join are problematic.
 - Comparing landowners and dates after join on NOAP-Unit-Unit-Activity.
 - Defining activities of interest -- restricted to "Clearcut/Overstory Removal" for now.
 - Defining landowner types of interest -- restricted to "Individual/Private Forestland Ownership" for now.
 - Filtering on duplication in the later period -- over all post-filtering columns for now.
 - Finding slopes and elevations for polygons (in the later period).
 - Finding slopes and elevations for centroids (in the later and earlier periods).
 - Correcting references from Hashida and Lewis to Hashida and Fenichel.
 - Parsing landowner types for Hashida and Fenichel.
 - Correcting apparent incorrect geolocation on PLSS for parcels landing in ~SE OR.
 - Choosing area of interest so that later and earlier periods match (see lines 240-246 as of 2025/08/01).
 - Matching MBF sums from both periods to generic aggregate data.
    - Subset less top 5% of notifications by MBF by year comes in w/ annual mean around 750000000 BF, < 3000000000
    - And trends aren't quite right.


working on:

- preceding problems
- notifications to elevations and slopes by polygons and centroids
- notifications to MTBS, UFMP following Wang and Lewis

- iterating over several models for combinations of categorical variables in the data, e.g. site class and pyrome
- adding stand destruction probabilities to the growth model
- adding other disturbances and treatments
- adding error quantification/visualization for the growth model
- parsing out post-SD initial conditions
- handling CA/WA data

notes from scratch work in R/Julia:

disturbances in only 187 of 2880 conditions (not counting by year, so fewer w/in interval of interest)
of those 187, year of disturbance is recorded for only 85
disturbances are distributed somewhat uniformly over codes, 
with disease damage, wind, and grazing (top three) accounting for a little over a third of obs

treatment is more common (488 obs), with removals accounting for 420 of those obs.
replanting and other commercial treatment account for almost all remaining 68 obs.
