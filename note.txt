recently done:

---

working on:

- iterative stuff to estimate several models over combinations of categorical variables in the data, e.g. site class and pyrome
- adding fake fire
- adding real fire
- adding other disturbances and treatments?

working on but in detail:
- grab Matt's sketch
- work out data interactions
- work out actual modeling
- figure out what to hand off

notes from scratch work in R/Julia:

disturbances in only 187 of 2880 conditions (not counting by year, so fewer w/in interval of interest)
of those 187, year of disturbance is recorded for only 85
disturbances are distributed somewhat uniformly over codes, 
with disease damage, wind, and grazing (top three) accounting for a little over a third of obs

treatment is more common (488 obs), with removals accounting for 420 of those obs.
replanting and other commercial treatment account for almost all remaining 68 obs.
