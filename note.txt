working on:

replicating MATLAB results in Julia with latest SC code

done: replicating in principle
not done: persuading optimization and growth function to play well
also not done: adding other loss functions, extending to multiple site classes etc

problems: 
growth function isn't quite matching MATLAB's optimized output (for regular NLLS) in the first place
growth function is pretty sensitive to reseeding Halton draws*
* but much less sensitive with the sum of squares loss function than the sum of absolute deviations

notes from scratch work in R/Julia:

disturbances in only 187 of 2880 conditions (not counting by year, so fewer w/in interval of interest)
of those 187, year of disturbance is recorded for only 85
disturbances are distributed somewhat uniformly over codes, 
with disease damage, wind, and grazing (top three) accounting for a little over a third of obs

treatment is more common (488 obs), with removals accounting for 420 of those obs.
replanting and other commercial treatment account for almost all remaining 68 obs.
