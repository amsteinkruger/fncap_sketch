# Objectives

This document processes data, fits a couple of models, then visualizes and discusses results.

Some specific objectives are:

1.  Figure out the basic structure of Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data.
2.  Set up data to model height at age for individual trees in Benton County, OR.
3.  Fit a simple linear regression and a minimal Von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF).

# Results Preview

-   FIA data are great, but modeling height at age for individual trees might be tough.

-   The data and models for Benton County work about as well as you'd expect.

-   This exercise sets several questions for next steps.

# Results

## 1. Data

```{r data, warning = FALSE}

dat_or_plot = "data/OR_PLOT.csv" %>% read_csv # 9 MB

dat_or_tree = "data/OR_TREE.csv" %>% read_csv # 429 MB

#  Check whether data support growth models from TOTAGE or CN/PREV_TRE_CN.

dat_or_tree %>% nrow

#   TOTAGE describes one-off age estimates.

dat_totage_check = dat_or_tree %>% drop_na(TOTAGE) %>% nrow

dat_totage_check

#   Relating CN to PREV_TRE_CN identifies repeated observations.

dat_cn_check = 
  dat_or_tree %>% 
  select(CN, PREV_TRE_CN)

dat_id_check = 
  dat_cn_check %>% 
  left_join(dat_cn_check, by = c("PREV_TRE_CN" = "CN")) %>% 
  left_join(dat_cn_check, by = c("PREV_TRE_CN.y" = "CN"))

dat_id_check %>% drop_na(PREV_TRE_CN.x) %>% nrow
dat_id_check %>% drop_na(PREV_TRE_CN.y) %>% nrow
dat_id_check %>% drop_na(PREV_TRE_CN.y.y) %>% nrow

# problem: there aren't a lot of trees with totage or repeated observations.
#  totage: 31835; these are almost all from 1999, which is unhelpful
#  cn: 325895 to 27136 to 0 for t-1, t-2, t-3

# so, lacking a perfect option, let's go with totage as the simpler imperfect option.

#  Subset to Benton County for local interest.

dat_benton = 
  dat_or_tree %>% 
  filter(COUNTYCD == 3) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(TOTAGE)) %>% 
  left_join(dat_or_plot %>% 
              filter(COUNTYCD == 3) %>% 
              select(INVYR,
                     MEASYEAR,
                     CN,
                     LON,
                     LAT,
                     ELEV),
            by = c("PLT_CN" = "CN",
                   "INVYR")) %>% 
  select(CN,
         INVYR,
         MEASYEAR,
         TOTAGE,
         DIA,
         HT,
         LON,
         LAT,
         ELEV) %>% 
  # Drop outliers for easier model fitting.
  mutate(rank = TOTAGE %>% percent_rank) %>% 
  filter(rank <= 0.90) %>% 
  select(-rank)

```

## 2. Geospatial Visualization

```{r map}

#  Get boundaries. These geodata originate with the Forest Service. 
#   See /data or /documentation for details.

dat_spa_boundaries = 
  "data/S_USA.ALPGeopoliticalUnit.gdb" %>% 
  vect %>% 
  subset(TYPENAMEREFERENCE == "County" & NAME == "Benton" & STATENAME == "Oregon", 
         NSE = TRUE)

dat_spa_plots = 
  dat_benton %>% 
  select(LON, LAT) %>% 
  distinct %>% 
  as.matrix %>% 
  vect("points",
       crs = crs(dat_spa_boundaries))

vis_spa_plots = 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_spatvector(data = dat_spa_boundaries) +
  geom_spatvector(data = dat_spa_plots) +
  theme_void()

ggsave("figures/vis_spa_plots.png",
       vis_spa_plots,
       dpi = 300,
       width = 6.5,
       height = 6.0,
       bg = "transparent")

```

![](figures/vis_spa_plots.png){width="80%," fig-alt="Plots in Benton County."}

There's a fair number of plots with values for TOTAGE around Benton County, so this subset could work.

## 3. Models and Visualization

```{r scatter, warning = FALSE}

#  Check out the data.

dat_benton %>% slice_head(n = 5)

vis_mod_scatter = 
  dat_benton %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = TOTAGE,
                 y = HT),
             alpha = 0.50) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) +
  theme_pubr()

ggsave("figures/vis_mod_scatter.png",
       vis_mod_scatter,
       dpi = 300,
       width = 6.5,
       height = 6.0,
       bg = "transparent")

```

![](figures/vis_mod_scatter.png){width="80%," fig-alt="Height at age."}

There's some clustering that suggests some covariates matter, but it's a nice distribution.

```{r model_linear, warning = FALSE}

#  Fit a linear model, just in case that does the trick.

mod_linear_benton = 
  dat_benton %>% 
  lm(formula = HT ~ TOTAGE, 
     data = .)

mod_linear_benton %>% summary

vis_mod_linear = 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = dat_benton,
             aes(x = TOTAGE,
                 y = HT),
             alpha = 0.50) +
  geom_line(data = dat_benton %>% filter(TOTAGE == TOTAGE %>% max | TOTAGE == TOTAGE %>% min),
            aes(x = TOTAGE,
                y = mod_linear_benton$coefficients[[1]] + mod_linear_benton$coefficients[[2]] * TOTAGE),
            alpha = 1.00,
            color = "#D73F09",
            linewidth = 1.00) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) +
  theme_pubr()

ggsave("figures/vis_mod_linear.png",
       vis_mod_linear,
       dpi = 300,
       width = 6.5,
       height = 6.0,
       bg = "transparent")

```

![](figures/vis_mod_linear.png){width="80%," fig-alt="A linear model of height at age."}

The simple linear model does a fair job, but doesn't return any exciting results.

```{r model_nonlinear, warning = FALSE}
#  Fit a nonlinear model (VBGF) for a more credible attempt.

library(gslnls) 

alpha_start = 200 # Asymptotic height.
beta_start = 1 # Inverse of annual growth rate.
gamma_start = 0 # Modeling artifact analogous to y-intercept.

mod_nonlinear_benton = 
  dat_benton %>% 
  filter(TOTAGE < 100) %>% 
  gsl_nls(fn = HT ~ alpha * (1 - exp(-(beta / 100) * (TOTAGE - gamma))),
          data = .,
          algorithm = "dogleg",
          start = c(alpha = alpha_start, 
                    beta = beta_start, 
                    gamma = gamma_start))

m_n_b_coef = mod_nonlinear_benton$m$getPars()

mod_nonlinear_benton %>% summary

fun_nonlinear_benton = 
  function(alpha, beta, gamma, age){
    alpha * (1 - exp(-(beta / 100) * (age - gamma)))
  }

vis_mod_nonlinear = 
  dat_benton %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = TOTAGE,
                 y = HT),
             alpha = 0.50) +
  geom_function(fun = fun_nonlinear_benton,
                args = list(alpha = m_n_b_coef[["alpha"]], 
                            beta = m_n_b_coef[["beta"]], 
                            gamma = m_n_b_coef[["gamma"]]),
                alpha = 1.00,
                color = "#D73F09",
                linewidth = 1.00) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) +
  theme_pubr()

ggsave("figures/vis_mod_nonlinear.png",
       vis_mod_nonlinear,
       dpi = 300,
       width = 6.5,
       height = 6.0,
       bg = "transparent")

```

![](figures/vis_mod_nonlinear.png){width="80%," fig-alt="A nonlinear model of height at age."}

The VBGF model also does a fair job. Casually, we might conclude the VBGF model is more useful than the simple linear model in that it represents decreasing growth in height at age. We might also conclude the gamma parameter in the VBGF model might as well be zero, as in some forestry literature.

# Brief Discussion

To recap initial objectives:

1.  FIA data represent fieldwork and analysis over a lot of different dimensions and units of analysis. That's exciting for data exploration. However, it does require another round of discussion on objectives and constraints for growth modeling. One alternative to modeling height at age could be modeling stand biomass, as in [Chisholm and Gray (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0302823). I'm sure there are other alternatives that could better fit project goals.
2.  FIA data constrain modeling height at age on repeated observations or one-off estimates of age, in that observations are not often repeated and there are not a lot of one-off estimates of age. There were enough one-off estimates of age to support simple models of height at age for Benton County, though, which is neat.
3.  The linear and nonlinear models for height at age did not return surprising results, although both were fine for the scope of this exercise. If modeling height at age (or other growth metrics) is of interest beyond this exercise, then these initial results might support further discussion.

Broadly:

-   Having done this, I'm in a better position to wrangle FIA data.

-   Messing with height at age was helpful for working out some intuition around different approaches to attributes of trees and stands, both within the FIA ecosystem and in broader forestry literature.

-   I did this in R to avoid delays and errors, but I'm looking forward to transitioning into Julia if that's the right path forward for more involved work.
